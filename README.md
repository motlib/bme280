Python module to query the Bosch Sensortec BME280 temperature,
pressure and humidity sensor.

For details of the sensor, refer to the datasheet available here:

<https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/bst/products/all_products/bme280>

## Usage

You can import the bme280.py module into your application and
instanciate the BME280 class. See the end of the bme280.py file for an
example of how to use the BME280 class.

Or you can run bme280.py as a stand-alone application. It will query
the sensor values once and print the result to the console. Run it as

 python bme280.py --help

to print the command-line help.
